This project is a product showcase with interactive features. It includes an image slider where users can view different product images by clicking on corresponding thumbnails. The selected thumbnail is highlighted with a border, and the main product image updates accordingly.

Below the image slider, there are options for users to choose the product color and size. When a color option is clicked, it is highlighted with a ring and border in the selected color. Similarly, users can select the product size by clicking on radio buttons.

Additionally, users can adjust the quantity of the product using the add and remove buttons. The quantity is displayed in the center, and users can increase or decrease it by clicking on the respective buttons.

Finally, there is an "Add to Cart" button that users can click to add the product to their cart. This button is styled with a shopping bag icon for visual appeal. Overall, the project provides a user-friendly interface for exploring product details and making purchasing decisions.
